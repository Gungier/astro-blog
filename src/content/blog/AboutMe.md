## Hey! welcome to my **[WebStite!!](/)**

### My name is Lila and I am an IB student living in Aarhus, Denmark.
<br/>
I created this website to give teenagers a voice while hardships around the world take place.  I love writing, singing, acting, reading among many other things.  I'm a second degree black belt in Taekwondo and currently training in Krav Maga. 
<br />


<br/>
In my free time I hang out with friends in the city or have sleepovers, travel and I like writing and reading fanfic!  I also enjoy acting and singing, which I'd drop everything for in a second to do.
<br/>


<br/>
It is always been important to me to speak out when I disagree with something, but I wanted to generate that feeling into something productive.  People around the world have problems that are not being talked about (and I want to provide a platform for this).  Sometimes they are smaller issues (in the eyes of others, but are significant to the people having the experience), and with this website I am giving teenagers a chance to talk about whatever is on their mind and let people know.  Educating yourself in a topic is important and so is educating others.  
<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to _**Global Tales**_!  Here is where change takes on a new meaning.
